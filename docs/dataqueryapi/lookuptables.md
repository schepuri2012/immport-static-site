The **lookup** tables or commonly referred to as controlled vocabulary tables are used in ImmPort as part of the data harmonization process. Many of the values in these tables are linked to Ontology defined terms. The following endpoints can be used to return the contents of these tables. All content is returned in JSON format. These endpoints require an ImmPort Access token.
